# cs3q2project
second quarter cs3 project. if not obvious already, a student project. If you managed to make it here and was never meant to, how?

[post creation commentary]

I wanted to put more things in here and fix up and clean a few things, but frankly put I just want it over with. This was supposed to be a passion project you know, I genuinely love the game being presented in this site and i feel like i've undersold it here so much. But I suppose time has no care for passions, besides, ive got bigger fish to fry.
